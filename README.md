_Let's go_

#### Data model
Before introduce the data model diagram we need to explain an easy sequence that will help to understand more easily the project.
``` 
User -> rol it web be gunticketer
Company -> companie where the user work
Event -> one of the attractions that the company have
Session -> an event could has one or multiple sessions
tickets -> tickets sold in that session
codes -> barcodes

User -> company -> event -> session -> tickets -> codes
```

#### Graphic functional
After we defined the data model we wil start with mockups of the web application.

First of all we will specify that it is a responsive web and the functional graph of which we can see the workflow will be designed for mobile.
